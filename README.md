This assignment is demostrating an unnamed c/2 orthogonal spaceship CA pattern, labeled 64P2H1V0. 

'Orthogonal' means the pattern travels in a straight line 'forward' based on its starting direction. In my case, the pattern is moving upward. 

'c/2' means that the pattern moves forward by one cell every 2 updates, also known as having a period of 2. 

The [starting pattern](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/64P2H1V0) and [rules](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) were written after consulting the [LifeWiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page) website.
